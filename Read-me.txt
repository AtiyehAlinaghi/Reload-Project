
How to Use the Reload Data Import Tool

1- Download the Data Folder

Obtain a dated folder (e.g., reload_03_03_2025) from the Reload Project SharePoint.
Access can be authorized upon request.

2- Prepare the Directory Structure

Place the jsonlab-master folder inside the downloaded folder (e.g., reload_03_03_2025/jsonlab-master).
This is required to enable reading .json files.

3- Run the MATLAB Script

Use the MATLAB file import_reload_data_summary.m. This script:

Iterates through all folders within the reload directory.

Extracts demographic information and recording data.

Saves a summary in an Excel file.

4- Update the Script Before Running

Set the correct parent folder path.

Specify the desired Excel file name.

Once you have the summary Excel file, e.g.:

excel_file = "Data_Reload_03032025_daily_update.xlsx"

1- Select Your Dataset

- The entire dataset.

- A specific subgroup sharing the same demographic information.

- Participants with at least 3 days of recordings for HMM tracking.

2- Extract Features and Labels

Use the Python script "reload_audio_feature_extraction_label.py" to:

- Go through all the folders and files to access the audio files,
& extract different sets of related acoustic features and associated labels.

3- Run Classification and Evaluation
With features and labels ready, run "reload_rti_svm_classification.py" to:

- Perform SVM classification & evaluate the performance.
